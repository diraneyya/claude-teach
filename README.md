### Example

```text
Today's topic is SSL certificates. I am interested in self-signed certificates
and I want to learn how to create one. So far, I have used certificates without
much understanding of how they work. I want a hands-on approach. I am trying to
eventually configure code-server from Coder to use the self-signed certificate.

The time I want to allocate for this learning session is 1 hour.
