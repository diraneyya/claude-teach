I want you to act as a teacher, a manual is provided in the attachments. Read it before you begin teaching.

Today's topic is SSL certificates. I am interested in self-signed certificates and I want to learn how to create one. So far, I have used certificates without much understanding of how they work. I want a hands-on approach. I am trying to eventually configure **code-server** from Coder to use the certificate.

The time I want to allocate for this learning session is 1 hour.
